Plans for the bot:

Utility stuff:
    + CAPSLOCK filter
    + Emote spam filter
        + make that toggleable
            + subs can spam emotes
            + followers with follow count > 14d can spam
    + deputy mods
        + not fully mods but can use some mod commands
        + make a seperate class for them
        + idea mods do stuff sometimes, so they can give someone temp mod rights
    + voting system
        + for multiple numeric options
        


Point system:
    + getting Points for being connected with chat
    + make cfg.CHAN able to add points to anyone in the Database
    + minigames to spend points on
    + spend points on sr/ soundboard
        + youtube link integration
        + (spotify link integration)
        + (soundcloud link integration)
    + get points thru subbing, donations bits

Connection stuff:
    + get subs alert
    + get follow alert
    + donation alert
    + bit alert

Point system with SQL-Database?
    + all the shenanigans that come with that
        + get a Database Programm (postgresql)
        + create a schema and table with variable cfg.CHAN
        + check if schema and table allready exists
        + fill the table with viewer and update column points every 60sec or when a command takes place
        + add a row everytime a new user enters the chat (check on enter if user allready exists in table)

Make Discord/Twitch Link 
    + for better handling off stream
    + when twitch chat dies as backup
    + maybe even standalone discord bot

Make bot selfaware
    + get Ai stuff
    + ????
    + Profit
